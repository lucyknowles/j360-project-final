			<h2> How I got here</h2>
				<p> Hello, my name is Lucy Knowles. I am a senior at Indiana Univeristy. I have lived in the USA for 8 years, Bloomington for 4. I was born in Southampton, England and grew up in Hampshire on the south coast of England until i was fourteen years old when i moved to Indianapolis, Indiana.
		</p>
		<p>
		After graduating the International School of Indiana, I moved to Bloomington to study at Indiana University. I entered the college as an undecided major but quickly decided that Journalism was something that I was interested in. I am now majoring in the Ernie Pyle school with a specialty in PR/ Advertising and a minor in Business. I will graduate in August 2016.
		</p>
	<p> I have studied spanish for many years and would love to be more fluent. Also, I have greatly enjoyed living in the United States, however have longed to be closer to England. Therefore, choosing Spain as my location for study abroad was an easy decision. Having visited as a child many times, it has always been a fun and vibrant place for me. My experiences in Spain and travelling around Europe were priceless, and I had valuable lessons during my travels. </p>
